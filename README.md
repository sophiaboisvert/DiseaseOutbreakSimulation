# DiseaseOutbreakSimulation
The purpose of this project is to simulate a disease outbreak and determine how many days the outbreak lasted and the infected, susceptible, and recovered on those days

Inputs: Total number of people in the simulation(int > 0) 
        Inital number of infected people (int > 0 and < total number of people)
        Rate of infection (between 0 and 1)
        Rate of Recovery (between 0 and 1)
        
Outputs: The number of infected, recovered, and susceptible of each day
